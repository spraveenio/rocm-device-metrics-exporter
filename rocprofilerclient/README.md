CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/rocm/lib/cmake/hip/hip-config-amd.cmake:98 (message):
   GPU_TARGETS was not set, and system GPU detection was unsuccsesful.

   The amdgpu-arch tool failed:
   Error: 'Failed to get device count'
   Output: ''

   As a result, --offload-arch will not be set for subsuqent
   compilations, and the default architecture
   (gfx906 for dynamic build / gfx942 for static build) will be used
