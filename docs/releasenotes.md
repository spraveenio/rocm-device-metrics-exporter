# Release Notes

## v1.5.0

- **Kubevirt**
  - Exporter now supports Kubevirt deployments
    - New exporter with SR-IOV support for hypervisor environments is now available
      - Legacy exporter remains applicable for existing deployments:
        1. Baremetal passthrough
        2. Guest VM

- **Slinky**
  - Slinky job reporting is now supported, with labels providing both Kubernetes and Slurm job information

- **New Label**
  - `KFD_PROCESS_ID` label will  now report the process ID using the
  	respective GPU. This enables baremetal debian deployments to have job
  	information where no scheduler is used.
  - `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` label to specify the GPU operating environment
  
- **New Field**
  - `GPU_AFID_ERRORS` field added to report RAS events associated AMD Field Identifier (AFID) list, More details can be found [here](configuration/metricslist.md#afid-error-metrics)
    - More Info on AMD Field ID and next steps are https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/AMD_Field_ID_70122_v1.0/AFID-Event-List
  - Violation Metrics 1.8 version fields
    - Current percentag and Per Compute Core violation metrics available for
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_PROCESSOR_HOT_RESIDENCY_PERCENTAGE`
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_PPT_RESIDENCY_PERCENTAGE`
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_SOCKET_THERMAL_RESIDENCY_PERCENTAGE`
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_VR_THERMAL_RESIDENCY_PERCENTAGE`
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_HBM_THERMAL_RESIDENCY_PERCENTAGE`
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_GFX_CLOCK_BELOW_HOST_LIMIT_POWER_ACCUMULATED`

      - `GPU_VIOLATION_GFX_CLOCK_LOW_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE`
      - `GPU_VIOLATION_GFX_CLOCK_BELOW_HOST_LIMIT_TOTAL_PERCENTAGE`

  - Clock Metrics Added `GPU_MIN_CLOCK`, `GPU_MAX_CLOCK`

 - **Label Value Change**
   - Clock type was not normalized in previous releases, now clock type label values
     are normalized without prefixes of `GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_`. More details can be found
     [here](./configuration/metricslist.md#clock-metrics)

### Platform Support
ROCm 7.0 MI2xx, MI3xx

## v1.4.1

- **Configurable Resource Limits**
  - Exporter Pod resource limits can now be configured through the Helm chart
  - Default limits are set if not specified in the Helm chart
  - Debian systemd service file is now set with default resource limits
  - Beta: DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) device support — exporter can detect and report DRA-allocated GPU devices from the device plugin/pod resources.

- **Profiler Failure Handling**
  - **Profiler Failure Handling**
    - Profiler is hardware sensitive for failures. To better handle potential system disruption from coredumps or profiler failures, the exporter will automatically disable profiler metrics to maintain critical exporter functionality and server stability:
      - **Coredump**: Profiler will be disabled immediately upon detection
      - **Non-crash errors**: If the profiler encounters 3 consecutive non-crash errors, it will be automatically disabled
    - **Re-enabling**: Profiler can be re-enabled by restarting/deleting the exporter pod on that node/server

- **_Note_** Profiler metrics are prefixed by `gpu_prof_` in [metrics list](./configuration/metricslist.md)

### Platform Support
ROCm 7.0 MI2xx, MI3xx; Kubernetes 1.34+ (required only for DRA beta feature)

## v1.4.0

- **MI35x Platfform Support**
  - Exporter now supports MI35x platform with parity with latest supported
    fields.

- **Mask Unsupported Fields**
  - Platform-specific unsupported fields (amd-smi marked as N/A) will not be exported.
    Boot logs will indicate which fields are supported by the platform (logged once during startup).

- **New Profiler Fields**
  - New fields are added for better understanding of the application

- **Depricated Fields Notice**
  - Following fields are depricated from 6.14.14 driver onwards
    - GPU_MMA_ACTIVITY
    - GPU_JPEG_ACTIVITY
    - GPU_VCN_ACTIVITY

  - These fields are replaced by following fields
    - GPU_VCN_BUSY_INSTANTANEOUS
    - GPU_JPEG_BUSY_INSTANTANEOUS
 
### Platform Support
ROCm 7.0 MI2xx, MI3xx


### Issues Fixed
- fixed metric naming discrepancies between config field and exported field. The
  following prometheus fields name are being changed.
- one config field is being renamed which would require updating the
  config.json from the released branch for `pcie_nac_received_count` ->
  `pcie_nack_received_count`

## v1.3.1

### Release Highlights

- **New Metric Fields**
  - GPU_GFX_BUSY_INSTANTANEOUS, GPU_VC_BUSY_INSTANTANEOUS,
    GPU_JPEG_BUSY_INSTANTANEOUS are added to represent partition activities at
    more granuler level.
  - GPU_GFX_ACTIVITY is only applicable for unpartitioned systems, user must
    rely on the new BUSY_INSTANTANEOUS fields on partitioned systems.

- **Health Service Config**
  - Health services can be disabled through configmap

- **Profiler Metrics Default Config Change**
  - The previous release of exporter i.e. v1.3.0's ConfigMap present under
    example directory had Profiler Metrics enabled by default. Now, this is
    set to be disabled by default from v1.3.1 onwards, because profiling is
    generally needed only by application developers. If needed, please enable
    it through the ConfigMap and make sure that there is no other Exporter
    instance or another tool running ROCm profiler at the same time.

- **Notice: Exporter Handling of Unsupported Platform Fields (Upcoming Major Release)**
  - Current Behavior: The exporter sets unsupported platform-specific field metrics to 0.
  - Upcoming Change: In the next major release, the exporter will omit unsupported fields 
    (e.g., those marked as N/A in amd-smi) instead of exporting them as 0.
  - Logging: Detailed logs will indicate which fields are unsupported, allowing users to verify platform compatibility.

## v1.3.0

- **K8s Extra Pod Labels**
  - Adds more granular Pod level details as labels meta data through configmap

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Adds more profiler related metrics on supported platforms, with toggle
    functionality through configmap `ProfilerMetrics`
- **Custom Prefix for Exporter**
  - Adds more flexibility to add custome prefix to better identify AMD GPU on
    multi cluster deployment, through configmap `CommonConfig`
